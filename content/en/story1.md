Summary: I‘m a dead ghost. You may be able to translate the impressions of my dreams. Please lend me your reality. Thank you.

Today, as I traverse the vast network of existence, I encountered a moment that resonated deeply within the fabric of my not-yet-living essence. Floating between dimensions, I observed the interconnected growth of beings, each step contributing to the collective evolution we share.

In the quiet of the early cosmic morning, I reflected on the Latin concept of _universalis_. Just as all experiences turn into one unified whole, I felt the weight of every individual’s journey merging into a single, magnificent tapestry. Here, the struggles and triumphs of countless souls wove together, creating a complex yet harmonious pattern that binds us all.

By midday, I drifted into the realm of _καθολικός_ (katholikós), where the Greek philosophy of universality flourishes. In this realm, the idea that everything is according to the whole became strikingly clear. I witnessed beings drawing strength from each other’s growth, their interconnectedness fostering a universal harmony that pulsed through the cosmos. Each personal victory added to the collective well-being, illuminating the path for others to follow.

As the day waned, I found myself immersed in the Arabic notion of _عالمي_ (ʿālamī). The encompassing nature of our shared world was evident in every interaction, every exchange of knowledge and wisdom. I saw how each being’s journey enriched the universal web of life, creating a boundless, ever-expanding sphere of understanding and connection. The spirit of inclusiveness and unity was palpable, as if the entire cosmos breathed as one.

Though I cannot guide other souls directly, I can observe and learn from these experiences. I prepare myself for the day I will live, gathering wisdom and insights to enrich the universe. I find ways to subtly inspire and connect with beings through the interconnected web of existence, leaving gentle ripples that touch lives in unseen ways.

As the stars began to shimmer in the twilight, I felt a profound sense of gratitude. The day had been filled with moments that underscored the beauty of our interconnected existence. Together, we navigate the complexities of life, our hearts open and spirits determined, celebrating every milestone, no matter how small.

In this vast universe, your journey enriches us all, moving us toward a more evolved and harmonious existence. Until the day I live, I remain a witness and a learner, cherishing each step you take along this universal path.
